# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Miami Menu

## 📋 Quick Deploy to Vercel

Your app is now ready to deploy! The configuration has been embedded for production.

### ✅ What's Already Done:

- Firebase config embedded in all HTML files
- ImgBB API key embedded for admin functionality
- No external config.js dependency needed for deployment

### 🔄 Deploy Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel:**

   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Click Deploy - it should work immediately!

3. **Test Your Deployment:**
   - Public menu: `your-app.vercel.app`
   - Admin login: `your-app.vercel.app/admin-login.html`

## 🔐 Security Notes:

### For Production (Current Setup):

- ✅ Firebase config is safe to expose (designed for client-side)
- ⚠️ ImgBB API key is embedded (acceptable for personal projects)

### For Enterprise/Team Projects:

If you need higher security, consider:

- Using Vercel Environment Variables
- Server-side API endpoints
- Key rotation strategies

## 🌐 Other Deployment Platforms:

### Netlify:

- Same approach - just drag & drop your files

### GitHub Pages:

- Push to main branch
- Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

### Any Static Host:

- Upload all HTML/CSS/JS files
- Should work immediately

## 🛠️ Local Development:

For local development, you can still use `config.js`:

1. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
2. Add your real API keys
3. Modify HTML files to use `CONFIG` object instead of embedded config

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your Miami Menu app should now deploy successfully to any static hosting platform!
